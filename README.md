Create an "Explore and Collect" game using Deck.gl for geospatial visualization, setting up the project environment to deploying the game. Here's a breakdown of the steps necessary to build this game, including logical points to add and commit files to a repository, with appropriate commit messages for each step.

## Step 1: Initialize the Project
Action: Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm or yarn. Set up a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules or other non-essential files. Add client directory with npx create-react-app and server directory for the backend
### Commit Message: "Initialize project and configure .gitignore"

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Action: Install necessary packages like deck.gl, @deck.gl/react, react-map-gl, mapbox-gl,  express, pg, axios and any other dependencies you might need.
### Commit Message: "Install initial dependencies for the project"

## Step 3: Set Up Basic Map Visualization
Action: Create a basic map component using Deck.gl and React. This component should display a map on the screen.
### Commit Message: "Implement basic map visualization with Deck.gl"

## Step 4: Define Data Models and Database Setup
Action: Define the data model for your POIs (Points of Interest), user visits and users in your database. If using PostgreSQL with PostGIS, set up your database and create tables for storing POIs and user collected items.
### Commit Message: "Setup database for POIs, user visits and user items"

## Step 5:Configure Database Connection
Set up a database connection using the pg library. It's a good practice to keep your database configuration details (like connection strings) in environment variables or a configuration file.
### Commit Message: "Configure Database Connection"

## Step 6: Implement Backend API
Action: Develop a backend API to manage POIs and user interactions. This could involve creating routes for fetching POI data, registering user collections, and handling user authentication if needed.
### Commit Message: "Create backend API for fetching POIs and handling user collections"

## Step 7: Implementing Geospatial Queries
For calculating the proximity between a player and POIs, you can use PostGIS functions such as ST_Distance
### Commit Message: "Create functions for postgis queries"

## Step 8: Integrate Frontend with Backend
Action: Connect your frontend application to the backend API. Implement functionality to retrieve POIs from the backend and display them on the map.
### Commit Message: "Integrate map with backend API to display POIs"

## Step 9: Add Explore and Collect Mechanics
Action: Implement the game mechanics that allow users to explore the map and collect POIs. Add ui for controlling player movement and write function for detecting when a user's location intersects with a POI and enabling a way to "collect" it.
### Commit Message: "Implement explore and collect mechanics for game"

## Step 10: User Interface and Interactivity Enhancements
Action: Enhance the user interface to improve the game experience. Add components for displaying collected items, user progress, and any other relevant information.
### Commit Message: "Enhance UI for better user experience and interactivity"
